-------------------------------------
Write a function called count_vowels that takes a string as input and returns the count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string. 
Ignore case sensitivity, meaning both uppercase and lowercase vowels should be counted.
--------------------------------------

def count_vowels(string1):
    count=0
    for s in string1:
        if s.lower() in 'aeiou':
            count+=1
    return count

---------------------------------
Write a function called common_elements that takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing 
only the elements that are common to both input lists. The order of elements in the new list doesn't matter.
---------------------------------

new_list=[]
def common_elements(list1,list2):
    for i in list1:
        if i in list2:
            new_list.append(i)
    return new_list
